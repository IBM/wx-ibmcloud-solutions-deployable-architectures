# Automated generative AI deployments on IBM Cloud - Deployable Architecture

## Introduction

Deploying enterprise level AI applications involves combining different cloud services in complex architectures which can result in security and compliance risks if not done carefully.
When building and delivering [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai?utm_source=ibm_developer&utm_content=in_content_link&utm_id=tutorials_awb-maximize-gen-ai-on-ibm-cloud-deployable-architectures&cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-tutorials-_-ibmcom) (Gen AI) solutions, clients need to consider not only the AI aspects but also the infrastructure, data layers, and non-functional requirements of a complete enterprise solution. These include security, compliance, and manageability.

[Deployable Architectures](https://www.ibm.com/blog/deployable-architecture-on-ibm-cloud-simplifying-system-deployment/?utm_source=ibm_developer&utm_content=in_content_link&utm_id=tutorials_awb-maximize-gen-ai-on-ibm-cloud-deployable-architectures&cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-tutorials-_-ibmcom) (DAs) can address these needs. DAs are automated reference architectures and solutions that allow clients to use IBM Cloud for faster deployment, enhanced security, continuous compliance, and seamless integration.
This lab guides you through a demo of the IBM Cloud Deployable Architecture for Retrieval Augmented Generation Pattern for watsonx (in short: RAG DA). This demo is a walk-through of an already deployed solution using RAG DA, so it does not actually go through the deployment, which could take a couple of hours for all the resources to be created.
