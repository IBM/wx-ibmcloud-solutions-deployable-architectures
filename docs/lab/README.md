# Automated generative AI deployments on IBM Cloud - Deployable Architecture

## Introduction

Deploying enterprise level AI applications involves combining different cloud services in complex architectures which can result in security and compliance risks if not done carefully.
When building and delivering [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai?utm_source=ibm_developer&utm_content=in_content_link&utm_id=tutorials_awb-maximize-gen-ai-on-ibm-cloud-deployable-architectures&cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-tutorials-_-ibmcom) (Gen AI) solutions, clients need to consider not only the AI aspects but also the infrastructure, data layers, and non-functional requirements of a complete enterprise solution. These include security, compliance, and manageability.

[Deployable Architectures](https://www.ibm.com/blog/deployable-architecture-on-ibm-cloud-simplifying-system-deployment/?utm_source=ibm_developer&utm_content=in_content_link&utm_id=tutorials_awb-maximize-gen-ai-on-ibm-cloud-deployable-architectures&cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-tutorials-_-ibmcom) (DAs) can address these needs. DAs are pre-configured reference architectures and solutions that help clients leverage IBM Cloud for faster deployment, enhanced security, continuous compliance, and seamless integration. 

This lab provides a demo of the IBM Cloud Deployable Architecture for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pattern with watsonx, referred to as the RAG DA. You will explore a DA that has already been deployed, allowing you to understand its functionality and benefits. Additionally, to kick off the lab you’ll have the opportunity to deploy your own DA to deepen your knowledge of the process. However, because your DA will take approximately an hour to complete, **<ins>all resources you’ll be working with during the lab are from the original deployment.</ins>**
