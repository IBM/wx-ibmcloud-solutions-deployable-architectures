# Deployable Architecture Overview

**Configuration and Customization:**
The DA is designed to be highly customizable, allowing users to add or remove components based on their specific needs and requirements. This ensures flexibility and adaptability to various use cases and environments.

**Rapid Deployment:**
By leveraging automation, the DA enables the rapid deployment of the entire solution stack. This significantly reduces the time and effort required to set up the infrastructure, allowing for deployment within hours.

## High-Level Workflow

1. **Deploy the DA Stack**: Participants begin by deploying the DA stack in the lab environment.

2. **Review Deployed Resources**: After deployment, participants will review the key resources within the account, such as Toolchains, Code Engine, Watsonx Governance, and Security and Compliance Center (SCC), to understand the infrastructure and services in place.

3. **Update Chatbot Knowledge Base**: Participants will update the chatbot’s knowledge base by adding new documents. They will then observe how these updates influence the chatbot’s responses.
