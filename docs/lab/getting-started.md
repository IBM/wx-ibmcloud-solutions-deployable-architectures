# Getting started

**Objective of this Lab** <br>
 <br>
The objective of this lab is to provide participants with hands-on experience in exploring a cloud environment where a Deployable Architecture (DA) has been deployed. The lab is structured to achieve the following goals:

1.	**Understand Deployed Resources:** In the first half of the lab, participants will examine the various cloud resources that have been deployed by the DA. This will include identifying and understanding the components and services that make up the deployed architecture, providing insight into how these resources integrate to form a secure and compliant generative AI (Gen AI) solution.

    In addition to this, participants will also have the opportunity to deploy their own DA to become familiar with the deployment process. However, it is important to note that the DA takes approximately an hour to build. **<ins>To ensure the lab remains efficient and focused, a DA has already been deployed and is ready for participants to explore the deployed resources without waiting for the build process to complete.</ins>**

2.	**Implement and Observe Changes:** In the second half of the lab, participants will gain hands-on experience with the Retrieval-Augmented (RAG) based chatbot. They will learn how to integrate new documents into the chatbot, enabling the chatbot to utilize these documents for more accurate and contextually relevant responses. 

By the end of the lab, participants will have a deeper understanding of deploying enterprise-level AI applications and acquire skills in document ingestion.
