# Conclusion and Next Steps

The objective of this lab was to provide participants with practical experience in navigating and manipulating a cloud environment where a Deployable Architecture (DA) has been deployed. Throughout the lab, participants successfully achieved the following:

1. **Understanding Deployed Resources:** Participants examined the various cloud resources deployed by the DA, gaining insights into the components and services that constitute the deployed architecture. This exploration provided a comprehensive understanding of how these resources integrate to form a secure and compliant generative AI (Gen AI) solution.

2. **Implementing and Observing Changes:** Participants engaged hands-on with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot. They learned to integrate new documents into the chatbot, enhancing its ability to deliver more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

Participants acquired a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in deploying enterprise-level AI applications. They also gained practical skills in document ingestion and the integration of cloud resources to support generative AI solutions.
